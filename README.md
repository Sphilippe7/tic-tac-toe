I used an SPA to make the game fluid and smooth.


I started off this project thinking of and going back to the ways in which we learned how to start in week 1. I created the wireframe fairly quickly so I reviewed notes and picked the best options that worked for me.

My user stories were as follows:

-users should be able to sign in with their email, create a password and be able to sign out
-users should be able to keep track of games played
-users should be able to change their passwords
-users should be able to reset and start a new game

I wanted to create a creative spin to the project but realized keeping it short and simple was the best option.

I'll continue to work and update this project over time
